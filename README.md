This repository contains the official implementation for the paper: 
**Complex Physics-Informed Neural Network**

We propose compleX-PINN, a novel physics-informed neural network (PINN) architecture incorporating a learnable activation function inspired by Cauchy’s integral theorem. By optimizing the activation parameters, compleX-PINN achieves high accuracy with just a single hidden layer. Empirically, we demonstrate that compleX-PINN solves high-dimensional problems that pose significant challenges for PINNs. Our results show compleX-PINN consistently achieves substantially greater precision, often improving accuracy by an order of magnitude, on these complex tasks.
